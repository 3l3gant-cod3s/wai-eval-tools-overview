  <p>Note about description: The video on this page does not include synchronized audio description because the visuals only illustrate the audio and do not provide additional information. In this case, audio description would be more distracting than useful to most people, including people who cannot see the visuals. Description of visual information is integrated in the Text Transcripts with Description of Visuals (“descriptive transcripts”).</p>

<p>Web accessibility evaluation tools are software programs or online services that help determine if web content meets accessibility standards.</p>

{% comment %}
This abuses the video-card component and tries to make it work with an embedded YouTube player that is enhanced with the AblePlayer library. Remove and replace with regular video-card component in case of bugs.
